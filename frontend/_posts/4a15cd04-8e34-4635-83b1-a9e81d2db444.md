# Deploying a Secure Static Website with Custom Domain on AWS Using Terraform

Deploying a static website involves several key AWS services, and securing it with HTTPS on a custom domain adds a layer of professionalism and trust. This guide outlines the steps to achieve this setup using Terraform, which simplifies cloud resource management through infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account.
- A custom domain managed by AWS Route53.
- Terraform installed on your local environment.

## Configuration Steps

### **Step 1: AWS Provider Setup**

First, define the AWS provider in Terraform:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

### **Step 2: S3 Bucket Configuration for Web Hosting**

Create S3 buckets for your domain and the www subdomain:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_site" {
  bucket = "yourdomain.com"
  acl    = "public-read"
  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "www_my_site" {
  bucket = "www.yourdomain.com"
  acl    = "public-read"
  website_redirect {
    host_name = "yourdomain.com"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: SSL Certificate with ACM**

Use AWS Certificate Manager to request a free SSL certificate:

```hcl
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "my_cert" {
  domain_name       = "yourdomain.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
}
```

### **Step 4: CloudFront Distribution for HTTPS**

Set up a CloudFront distribution to serve your site over HTTPS:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "my_site_cdn" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.my_site.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = "S3-yourdomain.com"
  }
  enabled             = true
  default_root_object = "index.html"
  ...
  viewer_certificate {
    acm_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.my_cert.arn
    ssl_support_method  = "sni-only"
  }
}
```

### **Step 5: Route53 Configuration**

Point your domain to the CloudFront distribution using Route53:

```hcl
resource "aws_route53_record" "my_site_record" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.my_zone.zone_id
  name    = "yourdomain.com"
  type    = "A"
  alias {
    name                   = aws_cloudfront_distribution.my_site_cdn.domain_name
    zone_id                = aws_cloudfront_distribution.my_site_cdn.hosted_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

### **Conclusion**

This setup not only enhances your website's security by enabling HTTPS but also leverages CloudFront for global content delivery and Route53 for DNS management, all automated with Terraform. Your static website is now more secure, faster, and scalable.
